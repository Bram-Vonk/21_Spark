`Enexis <http://www.enexis.nl>`__ is regulated regional distribution network operator (DNO) in the Netherlands, responsible for transporting electricity and gas to 2.6 million customers.
Enexis aims to keep the delivery af gas and electricity reliable, affordable and sustainable for all its customers.

About the current situation
----------
Power is delivered via grid components as cables and transformers (for electricity) to residential and industrial connections of our customers. These grid components have to have the needed capacity. This is monitored by Grid Planners and if needed transformers are swapped for heavier ones, or cable connections are strengthened.
For decennia this monitoring was done by mainly looking to historical yearly extremes. However, the increasing growth rate of power demand and supply driven by emerging technologies as electrical vehicles (EV) and photovoltaics (PV), requires shorter monitoring periods and nowadays even forecasts. Otherwise, there is no time for mitigating actions and customers will be out of power.

About this projects aim
----------
Enexis started a few years ago with the measurement of its distribution transformer population (in the project “distribution automation light” (DALI)). Power measurements are available that enable monitoring ad hoc by the grid planners.
This project takes the next step by forecasting on that data in autumn if a transformer overloads in spring.

About the structure of this project
----------
This project and its documentation are set up around the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining `[CRISP-DM] <https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/>`__.
It is an iterative process and this documentation focuses on the end result without ignoring the lessons learned along the way. The latter is generally noted at the end of every chapter.
